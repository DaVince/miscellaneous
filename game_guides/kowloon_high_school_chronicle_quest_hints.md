Introduction
------------

Quests are described like riddles, each consisting of three lines indicating three things:

1. The location - the room or area where you can find the item.
2. The target - indicates where in the area you should be or what object/enemy you should target.
3. The action to perform - maybe you have to wait, fight with a specific weapon, or do something else.

For example:
```
Where priests gather
Winged one
Defeat with sword
```

You can re-read the riddle summaries in the Quests screen, where they are glued together like so:
```
Where priests gatherWinged oneDefeat with sword
```

This document describes the meaning of each of the hints.

General tips & tricks
---------------------

* Whenever you enter a location that has one of your quest items, a special jingle sound will play upon entering the room.

* You can redeem the rewards from a quest by going into one of the spirit well rooms, and selecting the Gate to Yomi. Monster drops and quest items all end up in that area.

* If you don't feel like hunting for an item you already have on hand, you can opt to just hand over the one you have. However, this will give you one less opportunity to find that same item, so keep that in mind if it's something rare.

* For riddles that ask you to defeat a certain enemy in a certain way, the room will spawn an extra enemy that is the target. Said extra enemy is spawned in a set place in that room.
